## 📖 Best Practices

This repository adheres to React component best practices, including but not limited to:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Ensuring clean, modular component design.
2. **Prop-Driven UI**: Using well-defined props and PropTypes.
3. **State Management**: Leveraging `useReducer`, Context API, or external libraries like Redux.
4. **Reusability**: Creating reusable components and hooks.
5. **Performance**: Using `React.memo`, lazy loading, and dynamic imports.
6. **Scalability**: Structuring folders and components for large-scale applications.
7. **Testing**: Writing unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
